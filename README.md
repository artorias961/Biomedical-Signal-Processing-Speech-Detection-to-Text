The research relevance is based on the notion of the audio interpretation/understanding to grasp an internal representatopm of vibration that propagates 
as an acoustic wave. Inrepsonse to consumers' demands and technolgy from the time of using Ear Trumpet to Cochlear Implants. These instruments are needed 
for multimodal that have been based on translating acoustic waves to speech. However, implementing a code to gather virations into speech recognition, 
the process of the code will use Spectrogram to visually inspect the spectrum of frequencies of the given speech/phoneme.
